# Travel-Reservation-Database-Management-System
The architecture of the proposed Travel Reservation Database Management System
(TRDMS) is designed to be robust, scalable, and efficient, catering to the diverse needs of
travellers and service providers in the travel industry. 
The architecture comprises several key
components, each serving a specific role in facilitating the management of travel reservations.
Below is an overview of the architecture along with the methodology employed in designing
and implementing the TRDMS:

Client Interface:
The client interface serves as the front-end component of the TRDMS, providing users with
an intuitive and user-friendly interface to interact with the system.
It includes features such as search functionality, booking forms, account management, and
payment processing.
The interface is designed using web technologies to ensure compatibility across various
devices and platforms.

Application Layer:
The application layer acts as the intermediary between the client interface and the database
management system, handling user requests and processing data.
It includes modules for user authentication, data validation, search and filtering, booking
management, and communication with external APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
for real-time data updates.
The application layer is implemented using a server-side programming language such as,
Java along with frameworks and libraries for web development.

Database Management System (DBMS):
The DBMS serves as the back-end component of the TRDMS, responsible for storing,
retrieving, and managing data related to consumers, destinations, flights, hotels, and
reservations.

External APIs and Data Sources:
The TRDMS integrates with external APIs and data sources to access real-time information
such as flight schedules, hotel availability, and destination details.
APIs provided by airlines, hotel chains, travel aggregators, and tourism boards are utilized to fetch up-to-date data and provide users with accurate and relevant information during the booking
process.

Methodology
The design and implementation of the TRDMS follow a systematic methodology, whichincludes the following steps:
• Requirements Analysis: Gathering and analysing requirements from stakeholders, includingtravellers, travel agencies, accommodation providers, and airlines.System Design: Designing the architecture, database schema, user interface, and functionalities of the TRDMS based on the identified requirements.
• Development: Implementing the TRDMS components using appropriate technologiesand programming languages, following best practices for software development and database management.
• Testing:  onducting thorough testing and quality assurance to ensure the reliability,performance, and security of the TRDMS, including unit testing, integration testing, and useracceptance testing.
• Deployment: Deploying the TRDMS on a secure and scalable infrastructure, including webservers, database servers, and other necessary components. Maintenance and Support: Providing ongoing maintenance, support, and updates to the TRDMS to address issues, add new features, and improve performance based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
